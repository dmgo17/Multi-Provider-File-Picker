# Multi-Provider-File-Picker
A sample on using multiple storage providers to list files

## Steps
    1. Register your app in the stores (Microsoft and Google Dev programs)
    2. Add URI where your app resides and add it to the allowed URI list in your provider dev environment (Microsoft/Google)   
    3. Add the client ID's, deployment keys, etc to both, the google-file-picker and microsoft-file-picker js files
    4. Enjoy! :) 

### Still working on it..

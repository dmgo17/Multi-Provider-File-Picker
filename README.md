# Multi-Provider-File-Picker
This is a quick Node.js sample on using multiple storage provider file pickers to list and pick files. 

## Instructions
### Creating the apps in the providers
1. Register yourself in the [OneDrive](https://dev.onedrive.com/index.htm), [Google Drive](https://developers.google.com/drive/), and [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) Dev programs. 
2. Create an app in those providers, and get either app keys, client id, etc. that you will need to be able to hit their APIs from this sample. 
3. Add the URI where you are hosting this app sample to the allowed URI list in the providers dev environments   

### Installing the app sample
1. Make sure Node.js/Express is installed and running in the machine you are deploying this example
2. Add the client ID's, deployment keys, etc to the google-file-picker, and Index.html files
        * Just look for the word "here" in these files
3. Enjoy! :)
